We were entertaining friends from California, and enjoyed our ocean side table. We chose to stay indoors - to enjoy the air conditioning ðŸ˜Š. I just want to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful waitress, Jackie. She had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency. She recognized that we wanted time to visit and did not rush us. She and other staff members made certain that we had everything we needed. Kudos!"}

Please give our thanks to the Manager(s) and others for the wonderful room and bottle of sparkling wine for our Anniversary stay. We had an amazing time. The room was so comfortable, the food at Echo absolutely spectacular (we ate two meals there). Our waitress was just wonderful. Looking forward to staying with you in the future. What a great place!"}

We chatted with her all weekend and she played with the kids. She's an asset to the hotel esp for people with families. I saw other attendants playing with the kids too which is so welcoming. Rachel was gorgeous. Give her a raise!"}
